## Setup

To start your project, fork this repository
After forking the repo, your site will be live immediately on your personal Github Pages account, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repo. It might take some time for the site to propagate entirely.

## Customize

Things you can customise in `_data/settings.yml` (no HTML/CSS):
- Theme General Settings ( name, logo, email, phone, address )
- About Section
- Team Section
- Services Section
- Portfolio Section
- Client Slider Section
- Contact Section

## Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.
I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
